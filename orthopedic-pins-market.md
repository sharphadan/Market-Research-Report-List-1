<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Orthopedic Pins Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-Absorbable</li><li>Absorbable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The orthopedic pins market consists of two primary types: non-absorbable and absorbable pins. Non-absorbable pins are made from materials that do not break down in the body, providing long-term stability and strength for bone fixation, often used in complex fractures. Conversely, absorbable pins are designed to dissolve over time, eliminating the need for surgical removal and reducing the risk of complications. This type is beneficial in pediatric cases and soft tissue surgeries, promoting natural healing while minimizing foreign body presence.</p></p>
