<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The TFT Array Photoresist Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>TFT Positive Photoresist</li><li>TFT Negative Photoresist</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The TFT (Thin-Film Transistor) Array Photoresist market is segmented into positive and negative photoresist types, each serving distinct roles in semiconductor manufacturing. TFT positive photoresists are sensitive to light, enabling the formation of patterns by dissolving the exposed areas after exposure, suitable for high-resolution applications. Conversely, TFT negative photoresists harden where exposed, allowing unexposed areas to be developed away, ideal for applications requiring thicker layers. Both types are essential for enhancing the efficiency and performance of electronic devices.</p></p>
